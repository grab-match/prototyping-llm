Thought: This is about creating a full-day itinerary for a date, starting at 09:00 and lasting for 12 hours. The itinerary should include visits to parks and restaurants nearby. The start time should be at 09:00, and it should end at 21:00. The goal is to recommend locations with high ratings and ensure the timing aligns with their open hours.
Action: Calculate the best route and create a JSON itinerary based on the provided data and the user's location.
Observation: User location is on latitude -6.194031 and longitude 106.832587. The data includes parks and restaurants with their opening hours and ratings. Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for the best path isn't necessary in this context because all locations are within a small area. Instead, create a logical itinerary based on open hours and proximity.
